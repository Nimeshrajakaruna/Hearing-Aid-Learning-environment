This repository contains MATLAB and Simulink files for the project "Human Voice Filtering System for Hearing Aid Devices to Utilize in Learning Environments." The project aims to design and implement an intelligent system that enhances the clarity of human speech for individuals using hearing aids in educational settings. The system employs advanced signal processing techniques to filter out background noise and amplify human voices, thereby improving communication and learning experiences for hearing-impaired individuals.
